						<p>Before finishing up at Framestore, I made sure to download all the nuke courses I could get a hold of with my company fxphd account. I spent the following weeks completing all these and managed to finish them all before Christmas, this process was super rewarding, I had plenty to do and a schedule to stick to - it helped me a lot in such uncertain times. Some of my favourite courses include; Photorealism in Compositing with NUKE, Nuke & Digital Environments, Project Masterclass â€“ The Machine as well as Josh Park's CG Compositing Course and Tony Lyons' Advanced Keying Breakdown. During that time I finished 24 courses in total and attended many Foundry Skill Up events. I found my time in Framestore and as an apprentice at Westminster Kingsway had already taught me more than I realised but these courses helped me delve even deeper and find out the <i>"whys"</i> behind the <i>"hows"</i>.</p>

						<p>I came out of it all with a ton of notes and some good plates to practice on. In January I worked on a few shots from these courses. I converted some breakdowns of these into gifs as seeen above and below. </p>

						<p>In February I went out to shoot some of my own plates with the hope of using them alongside FXPHD assets to create an unique reel. While I didn't refer to the step by step's from the courses while completing the shots in January, I found reworking them again with my own plates in February to be very valuable further practice and even better reel material.</p>

						<p>Going forward I plan to learn more about photography to further understand how the world looks through a camera so I can effectively replicate that in my shots. I am also interested in getting back into coding, which I haven't looked at since University, by learning some python and blinkscript. I do however want to keep perfecting my fundamental compositing skills throughout, I'm glad I have many notes to look back on!</p>
